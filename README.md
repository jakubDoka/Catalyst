# Catalyst

## Motivation

I love meta-programming, it brings me joy to create DSL-s that make my code expressive, optimal and beautiful. I am lazy, newer wanting to repeat my self. I crave for smooth development cycle. I want to feel confident about every line I write. I desire low level control that can be wrapped in high level zero cost abstraction. I hate garbage collector and weak type system. And finally, I want my own programming language.

As a bonus, I improve my skills.

## Inspiration

Nim, Rust and Go in that order. Also encapsulation and methods from OOP.

## Features

Main features of this project are

- program validation
- binary generation
- formatting source
- dependency management

I will address this project as a compiler for sanity reasons but Catalyst is not only compiler. Compiler in general just translates code to other code. Goal of this project is to make a tool to help with building software as much as possible.

## TODO

- describe features in more detail

## Contribution

Is not recommended, code is not documented and changes quickly. I want to improve this as state of project stabilizes. On the other hand open critics on my code is welcomed and can be performed trough issues.

### How to run Tests

My development environment is `Windows 10` (sorry) and only dependant part of project are `.bat` files though i kept them simple anr rewriting them to bash should be easy (contribution opportunity).
