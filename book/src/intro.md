# Introduction

This book documents my progress trough development of
[Catalyst](http://github.com/jakubDoka/Catalyst), low level, metaprogramming
focused language with advanced `compiler <-> code` intreoperability. It is
written in and inspired by [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust). 

Book is divided into same structure as compiler source code. Leaf nodes are
then divided into sections each describing my approach of solving the
compiler problem.

Before we start I want to clarify, I make a lot of typos and often don't
notice them, so feel free to fix them with a PR.
